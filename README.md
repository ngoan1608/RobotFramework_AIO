[![Build RobotFramework AIO packages](https://github.com/test-fullautomation/RobotFramework_AIO/actions/workflows/build_robotframework_aio.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/test-fullautomation/RobotFramework_AIO/actions/workflows/build_robotframework_aio.yml)

This respository holds the build tooling for a new Robot Framework AIO (All In 
One) setup for both Windows and Linux.


[![Attention](https://https://github.com/test-fullautomation/RobotFramework_AIO/tree/develop/include/png/attention.png)](https://robotframework-aio.org)

If you want to contribute to develop RobotFramework AIO, and therefore build it 
manually, then please proceed reading here.

!! Consider also !! \
In most cases it's not required to build manually. Our 
RobotFramework AIO actions can do this for you.
Contribution is also possible by just working on the repository where
you want to contribute. Most of the repositories have no dependency on
the overall build and run also stand-alone.

## Getting Started

### Manual build
Currently, RobotFramework AIO is supported to build with both **Windows** and 
**Linux** environments.

#### Preconditions
Building a RobotFramework AIO installer includes rendering the documentation. 
This requires the availability of some additional applications that have to be 
installed at first.

[TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/) is used for rendering the documentation and need to be installed first.
The full collection is recommended to avoid issue when generating document but it will take long time for the installation. 
In case the full collection installation is not possible, at least 2 collections `texlive-latex-extra` and `texlive-fonts-recommended` should be installed together with the basic package.

Please refer [requirements_linux.sh](./requirements_linux.sh) or 
[requirements_windows.sh](./requirements_windows.sh) for the dependency packages 
for **Linux** and **Windows** environments.

#### Execute build scripts
Clone this [RobotFramework_AIO](https://github.com/test-fullautomation/RobotFramework_AIO) repository first
```
git clone https://github.com/test-fullautomation/RobotFramework_AIO.git
```

Then follow below steps for building process:

1. Clone all related repositories that are configured in the [config/repositories/repositories.conf](https://github.com/test-fullautomation/RobotFramework_AIO/blob/develop/config/repositories/repositories.conf) file
	```
	./cloneall
	```

2. Download and install Python 3.9 (include dependencies which are defined in `install/python_requirements.txt`), vscode (include the extensions which defined in `install/vscode_requirement.csv` or stored as *.vsix file under `config/robotvscode/extensions` folder) and pandoc
	```
	./install/install.sh
	```
	>Note: In case you are working behind the proxy, 
	[cntlm authentication proxy](https://sourceforge.net/projects/cntlm/) 
	should be installed and started first then
	execute the `install.sh` with `--use-cntlm` argument as below command:
	
	```
	./install/install.sh --use-cntlm
	```

3. Build the installer package
	```
	./build
	```

	Build the RobotFramework AIO package with all related libraries 
	(defined in `config/repositories/repositories.conf` file).


	Build script will detect the operating system (**Windows** or **Linux**) 
	automatically to run the appropriate steps for building installer package.

	The new generated RobotFramework AIO setup file can found under `Output/` folder 
	on Windows and `output_lx` on Linux machine.

#### Repositories configuration file
The repositories configuration file `repositories.conf` allows you to manage various repositories across different Git servers.

[config/repositories/repositories.conf](https://github.com/test-fullautomation/RobotFramework_AIO/blob/develop/config/repositories/repositories.conf) is used as default for [cloneall](https://github.com/test-fullautomation/RobotFramework_AIO/blob/develop/cloneall), 
[gitall](https://github.com/test-fullautomation/RobotFramework_AIO/blob/develop/gitall) 
and [build](https://github.com/test-fullautomation/RobotFramework_AIO/blob/develop/build) scripts (without specifying in command line argument)

However, you can define your own `repositories.conf` configuration file (remove/add repositories from multiple Git servers) and use it for those scripts.
* Define supported git server(s) (alias name) and their project/user url in `[supported-server]`
	```
	[supported-server]
	gitlab=https://gitlab.com/robotframework-aio
	github=https://github.com/test-fullautomation
	bitbucket=ssh://git@bitbucket.org:7999/robfw
	```
* List all repositories for each supported Git server
	```
	[gitlab]
	robotframework-otherlibraries=
	...

	[github]
	robotframework=
	...

	[bitbucket]
	python-libraries=
	...
	```
	You can also specify the *branch*/*commit*/*tag* to switch to after cloning (only used for `cloneall` script)
	```
	...
	[github]
	robotframework=develop_6.1
	...
	```

Then, execute the scripts with additional argument `--config-file=<path-to-your-config-file>`
```
./cloneall --config-file=<path-to-your-config-file>
```

```
./gitall --config-file=<path-to-your-config-file> <git-command>
```

```
./build --config-file=<path-to-your-config-file>
```
#### Other tools:
1. [gitall](https://github.com/test-fullautomation/RobotFramework_AIO/blob/develop/gitall)

	The `gitall` tool allows to execute Git commands across multiple repositories defined in a above repositories configuration file.
	Before using `gitall`, ensure that all repositories have been cloned with the `cloneall` tool.

	Usage:
	* Check status
		```
		./gitall
		```
		or
		```
		./gitall status
		```
	* Create git commit:
		```
		./gitall commit -m "Commit message"
		```
	* Use with custom repositories configuration file:
		```
		./gitall --config-file=<path-to-your-config-file> commit -m "Commit message" 
		```

### Github Actions

#### Workflow
The workflow to build RobotFramework AIO package is available in 
"Github Actions" of this repository.

There are build jobs available for both environments **Windows** and **Linux**. 
These build jobs contain the following main steps: 
- `Install dependencies`: install dependency packages for build job
- `Clone repositories` : clone all related repos to build runner
- `Install` : install python, vscode and their dependencies
- `Build` : build the package installer
- `Upload build package` : save the build package as workflow artifactory 

#### Runners
Currently, there are two runners (GitHub-hosted) available for build pipelines:
- Windows runner: [Windows Server 2022](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/win/Windows2022-Readme.md) with label `windows-latest` for Windows job.
- Ubuntu runner: [Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/linux/Ubuntu2204-Readme.md) with label `ubuntu-latest` for Linux job.
