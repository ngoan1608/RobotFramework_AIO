   # Every file contains the complete history of all changes within a certain component. The goal is to inform the readers of the release mail about relevant changes.
   # This is another scope than the history in the documentation of the component. Here the information might be more technical and is related to the version number
   # of the component. The history in the documentation of the component is the history of the component. The history in the release item files is the history of changes
   # of this component between two releases of the RobotFramework AIO. Between these scopes there is not necessarily a full match.
